# CafeOrderingSystem

I participated in a company hackathon where we got into teams of five and had 20 hours to design and implement a new product for UPS. We chose to do an online ordering system for our on site cafeterias because the lines tend to get quite long during peak hours. I had never done any kind of web design, and those of us that had on our team had only done front end. Thankfully, through the power of energy drinks and pizza, all things are possible. I wrote the python back end, as well as few of the html pages. 

We ended up placing first out of nine teams for the Atlanta branch of the hackathon, and went on to represent Atlanta UPS at the national level where we competed against the winning teams from the Kentucky and New Jersey locations, where we all tied for first.
